## About
 
This repo is meant to track my learning progress on algorithms and data structures using real problems from LeetCode.

---

## Structure

Here you will find the summary of all the problems I have solved. Each problem is documented with its description, solution, and explanation.

To view the full summary of all exercises, simply access the summary.md.

If you wish to filter problems by difficulty, you can check the following files:

Easy Problems: easy.md\
Medium Problems: medium.md\
Hard Problems: hard.md

## Repository Structure
Each problem is organized in its own directory, containing:

- description.md: The problem statement.
- explanation.md: A detailed explanation of the approach and logic used.
- solution: The implemented solution in the language.

## Multilingual Support
To cater to a broader audience, I provide documentation in both English and Portuguese. The structure for each problem is as follows:

```├── problems\
│   └── solutions
│       ├── 001-two-sum
│       │   ├── en/
│       │   │   ├── description.md
│       │   │   └── explanation.md
│       │   ├── pt/
│       │   │   ├── descricao.md
│       │   │   └── explicacao.md
│       │   └── solution
│       │
│       └── 002-add-two-numbers
│           ├── en/
│           │   ├── description.md
│           │   └── explanation.md
│           ├── pt/
│           │   ├── descricao.md
│           │   └── explicacao.md
│           └── solution
```
> This format ensures consistency and makes it easy to navigate through the problems I've tackled in both languages.
